Double Wide LED version: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2989552  

## Upgrading from version 2.5 or Higher
Version 2.5 introduced the ability to upgrade pre-compiled firmware from a binary file.  In version 2.6 and on you should find binary files that can be uploaded to your marque scrolling clock via the web interface.  From the main menu in the web interface select "Firmware Update" and follow the prompts.
* **marquee.ino.d1_mini_2.16.bin** - compiled for Wemos D1 Mini and standard 4x1 LED (default)
* **marquee.ino.d1_mini_wide_2.16.bin** - compiled for Wemos D1 Mini and double wide 8x1 LED display

## Compiling and Loading to Wemos D1
It is recommended to use Arduino IDE.  You will need to configure Arduino IDE to work with the Wemos board and USB port and installed the required USB drivers etc.  
* USB CH340G drivers:  https://sparks.gogo.co.nz/ch340.html
* Enter http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json into Additional Board Manager URLs field. You can add multiple URLs, separating them with commas.  This will add support for the Wemos D1 Mini to Arduino IDE.
* Open Boards Manager from Tools > Board menu and install esp8266 Core platform version **2.5.2**
* Select Board:  "LOLIN(WEMOS) D1 R2 & mini"
* Set 1M SPIFFS -- **this project requires SPIFFS for saving and reading configuration settings.**
* Select the **Port** from the tools menu.  

## Loading Supporting Library Files in Arduino
Use the Arduino guide for details on how to installing and manage libraries https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries  
**Packages** -- the following packages and libraries are used (download and install):  
<ESP8266WiFi.h>  
<ESP8266WebServer.h>  
<WiFiManager.h> --> https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager  
"FS.h"  
<SPI.h>  
<TimeLib.h> --> https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Time  
<Adafruit_GFX.h> --> https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library  
<Max72xxPanel.h> --> https://github.com/markruys/arduino-Max72xxPanel  
<JsonStreamingParser.h> --> https://github.com/squix78/json-streaming-parser  

Note ArduinoJson (version 5.13.1) is now included as a library file in version 2.7 and later.

## Initial Configuration
Starting with version 2.0 editing the **Settings.h** file is optional.  All API Keys are now managed in the Web Interface except for the GeoNames Key. It is not required to edit the Settings.h file before loading and running the code.  
* Open Weather Map free API key: http://openweathermap.org/  -- this is used to get weather data and the latitude and longitude for the current time zone. Weather API key is required for correct time.
* TimeZoneDB free registration for API key: https://timezonedb.com/register -- this is used for setting the time and getting the correct time zone as well as managing time changes due to Day Light Savings time by regions.  This key is set and managed only through the web interface and added in version 2.10 of Marquee Scroller. TimeZoneDB key is required for correct time display.
* News API key (free): https://newsapi.org/ -- Optional if you want to get current news headlines.
* Your OctoPrint API Key -- optional if you use the OctoPrint status.
* Version 2.0 supports Chained 4x1 LED displays -- configure in the Settings.h file.  

NOTE: The settings in the Settings.h are the default settings for the first loading. After loading you will manage changes to the settings via the Web Interface. If you want to change settings again in the settings.h, you will need to erase the file system on the Wemos or use the “Reset Settings” option in the Web Interface.  

## Web Interface
The Marquee Scroller uses the **WiFiManager** so when it can't find the last network it was connected to 
it will become a **AP Hotspot** -- connect to it with your phone and you can then enter your WiFi connection information.

After connected to your WiFi network it will display the IP addressed assigned to it and that can be 
used to open a browser to the Web Interface.  You will be able to manage your API Keys through the web interface.  
The default user / password for the configuration page is: admin / password  

The Clock will display the time of the City selected for the weather.

Contributing to this software is warmly welcomed. You can do this basically by forking from master, committing modifications and then making a pulling requests against the latest DEV branch to be reviewed (follow the links above for operating guide). Detailed comments are encouraged. Adding change log and your contact into file header is encouraged. Thanks for your contribution.

When considering making a code contribution, please keep in mind the following goals for the project:
* User should not be required to edit the Settings.h file to compile and run.  This means the feature should be simple enough to manage through the web interface.
* Changes should always support the recommended hardware (links above).
